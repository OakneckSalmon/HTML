        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Raymond, and I am from New York; and I've been studying to become a web developer for a few months. For me to practice my skills;  I decided to create a webpage about me and my hobbies.</p>
        <p>This year has been pretty crazy with the whole pandemic, so I decided to learn how to code with so much time in hand. I tried learning C, Python, and Java, but I like html and css. </p>
